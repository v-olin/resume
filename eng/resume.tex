                During secondary school I discovered\\

                After secondary school I went on\\
                a sabbatical year and worked for\\
                education group AcadeMedia, where\\

                an engineer with a speciality of computer\\

                been fascinated by computers ever since\\
                I was young and during my first two years\\
                at Chalmers, I have learned a lot and\\

                experience and I got to take part in the\\
                workflow of an IT department and see what\\
                challenges you are facing on a daily basis.\\
                I also took part in larger projects during\\
                my time there regarding development of\\

                I have learned a lot from my years as a scout,\\
                including leadership skills, survival skills\\
                and teamwork during tough conditions. I took\\
                part in nightly sailings to and from Gotland\\
                during gales, skied 100 miles in the mountains\\
                during hurricanes and being a group leader for\\
                younger scouts. I have also had responsibilities\\
                from working in shifts during long sailings\\
                and ventures.\\\\
                When I was younger I competed in air rifle\\
                shooting. In 2015 I won the district\\
                championship in Stockholm and placed 9th\\
                in the national championships.\\\\
